#setup the project
clone the repo and open in any of your code editor.
go to terminal and do a quick
`npm install`

in the root folder create a `.env` file and add the following

`PORT` = //give a port number must be different form Lcash main server
`GMAIL_EMAIL` = //gmail of your service from which all mails will be sent
`GMAIL_PASS`  = //the app pass for the mail, search for how to add a app pass to google account

then you are good to go, do a `npm run dev` and play with the apis.
